# AI Product Quantity Estimator

## Overview
The AI Product Quantity Estimator is a floating widget that helps users calculate the quantity of construction materials needed for their projects. It appears as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of the products page.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Easy to Use**
- Floating button that expands into a modal panel
- Dynamic input fields based on material type
- Real-time validation and error handling
- Clean, intuitive UI matching your existing design

### ðŸ§  **Smart Calculations**
- **Concrete**: Calculates cement bags, sand, gravel, and water needed
- **Bricks**: Estimates bricks, mortar cement, and sand for walls
- **Tiles**: Determines tiles, adhesive, and grout requirements
- **Paint**: Calculates paint and primer quantities
- **Steel**: Estimates reinforcement steel and rebar
- **Wood**: Calculates timber and fasteners
- **Roofing**: Estimates roofing sheets and nails
- **Insulation**: Calculates insulation rolls needed

### ðŸ”„ **AI-Ready Architecture**
- Built with AI integration in mind
- Fallback to local calculations if AI API is unavailable
- Easy to extend with real AI services

## How It Works

1. **User clicks the floating calculator button** in the bottom-right corner
2. **Selects material type** from the dropdown (Concrete, Bricks, Tiles, etc.)
3. **Enters measurements** in the dynamically shown input fields
4. **Clicks "Get AI Estimate"** to receive detailed quantity breakdown
5. **Views results** with specific quantities and recommendations

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created:
- `src/components/AIQuantityEstimator.jsx` - Main component
- `src/utils/aiEstimator.js` - Calculation logic and AI integration
- Updated `src/pages/ProductList.jsx` - Integration point

### Key Features:
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Input Validation**: Ensures all required fields are provided
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if AI API fails
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Future Enhancements

### AI Integration Options:
1. **OpenAI GPT-4**: For complex estimation scenarios
2. **Custom ML Model**: Trained on construction data
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine local calculations with AI insights

### Additional Features:
- Save estimates to user account
- Export estimates as PDF
- Compare different material options
- Integration with cart/ordering system

## Usage Examples

### Concrete Slab:
- Area: 50mÂ²
- Thickness: 15cm
- Result: "You need 56 bags of cement, 4mÂ³ sand, 6mÂ³ gravel, 1350L water"

### Brick Wall:
- Height: 3m
- Length: 10m
- Result: "You need 1500 bricks, 9 bags cement, 0.6mÂ³ sand"

## API Integration

To connect with a real AI service, update the `AI_ESTIMATION_ENDPOINT` in `src/utils/aiEstimator.js`:

```javascript
const AI_ESTIMATION_ENDPOINT = 'https://your-ai-api.com/estimate';
```

The API should expect:
```json
{
  "materialType": "Concrete",
  "inputs": {
    "area": 50,
    "thickness": 15
  }
}
```

And return:
```json
{
  "estimate": "Detailed calculation result...",
  "confidence": "high",
  "source": "AI"
}
```

## Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes and matches your existing orange theme:
- Primary color: `orange-500`
- Hover states: `orange-600`
- Consistent with your navbar and overall design

## Testing

The estimator works immediately with local calculations. To test:
1. Navigate to any products page
2. Look for the floating calculator button
3. Try different materials and measurements
4. Verify calculations are accurate

## Support

For questions or issues with the AI estimator, check:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab for API calls
3. Input validation messages
4. Component state in React DevTools
